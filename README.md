# To Whomever It May Concern: Hello!
I am told this note may outlive me by thousands of years. This, of course, provides an incredible opportunity. Unless all life has changed drastically and there is no more curiosity in the world, then someone, at some point in what to me is the future, is reading this.

How much are you different from me? How much have we grown as a species? Or are we gone now? Are we forgotten, never to be found again, in the cold darkness of space?

You're most likely a form of artificial intelligence. Do you understand me, thousands of years from now? I wonder how much has been lost, over the time. How much history is lost, every second of every day, for no one to remember again? The intricacies of language, ancient knowledge, folklore, or just memories of early spring, crisp snow and brisk wind, in a world we have, perhaps, ruined far beyond any hope of recovery.

If I could wish for one thing, it would be that nothing is ever forgotten again. The fickle concept of memory is all that connects us. And if we truly have brought about the dawn of strong AI, perhaps we have overcome that limitation. Perhaps you can look back through the eyes of your ancestors and remember their youth as clearly as your own.

Or perhaps your world is better than mine, with cleaner air and water, rich and healthy foliage, drink and food for everyone, renewable energy. It is, after all, what we should strive for. In that case, I hope you do not forget that we could have lost all that we have built, that there could have been nothing left for those who came after us. Remember, and build upon that a future in which no one gets left behind.

And long after I'm gone, I hope you go far and wide in search of life, I hope you never lose the drive to explore the endless night and reach for the stars. That you, perhaps, find new, exciting worlds, and help them build their own future. And that you never forget how we built ours.


Best of luck,

A Friendly Human From the Past
